## About Me

Hello! I am Chhaya Choudhary!

I am a Graduate Student in Computer Science and Systems Department at [University of Washington Tacoma](https://www.tacoma.uw.edu/). My fields of interest are Machine Learning, Deep Learning, Natural Language Processing, Distributed Computing and Algorithms. I will be graduating in Dec 2018 and currently looking for Summer Intership opportunities.

I recently started working on a research project at University of Washington under the supervision of [Prof. Martine De Cock](https://www.tacoma.uw.edu/institute-technology/martine-de-cock-phd) in collaboration with [Infoblox](https://www.infoblox.com/)
on Detecting DDoS Attacks Against DNS Servers using Machine Learning techniques.

## Projects
### [Age, Gender and Personality Trait Prediction of FaceBook Users](https://github.com/chhayac/Gender-Classification-Using-Images)                                
- Designed and developed Deep Neural Network to predict age and gender of FaceBook users using 9500 proﬁle pictures with 87% accuracy. 
- Developed machine learning models to predict personality traits (openness, agreeable, extrovert) of FaceBook users using Linguistic Inquiry and Word Count (LIWC) features. 
- Technical Proﬁciency Demonstrated: Python, Convolutional Neural Networks, Keras, Tensorﬂow, Scikit-Learn, Transfer Learning, Numpy, Pandas, Jupyter, Matplotlib 

### [Machine Learning Notebooks](https://github.com/chhayac/Machine-Learning-Notebooks)
These are my Jupyter Notebooks where I experiment with various machine and deep learning frameworks.

### Empirical Study of Network Flow Algorithms                                                      
- Implemented Ford-Fulkerson, Scaling Ford-Fulkerson, and Preﬂow-push algorithms in Java to ﬁnd maximum ﬂow in a network and performed empirical study with Random, Bipartite and Mesh graphs.
- Technical Proﬁciency Demonstrated: Java, Git, Algorithms and Data-Structures 

### Simulation and Visualization of 5 Sorting Algorithms                                            
- Developed a simulation experiment to compare and contrast various sorting algorithms by drawing real-time graphs and interpreting their behaviors on various degree of sortedness. 
- Technical Proﬁciency Demonstrated: Python, Git, Matplotlib

### [Data Structure and Algorithm problems](https://github.com/chhayac/algo_and_data_structures)
This is my repository where I solve interesting algorithms and data structure problems.
