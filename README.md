## About Me

Hello! I am Chhaya Choudhary!

I am a Graduate Student in Computer Science and Systems Department at [University of Washington Tacoma](https://www.tacoma.uw.edu/). My fields of interest are Machine Learning, Deep Learning, Natural Language Processing, Distributed Computing and Algorithms. I will be graduating in April 2019 and currently looking for Summer Internship opportunities.

I am working on a research project at University of Washington under the supervision of [Prof. Martine De Cock](https://www.tacoma.uw.edu/institute-technology/martine-de-cock-phd) on Detection of Domain Generation Algorithms (DGA) using Deep Learning. My Capstone (thesis) focuses on protecting DGA classifiers against Adversarial examples using Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs). Please download my [resume](https://github.com/chhayac/chhayac.github.io/blob/master/Chhaya_Resume_Git.pdf) here.
